This is a generative AI website, where you can transform your scribbles into realistic and vibrant representations. Crafted using Next.js, Tailwind CSS and Convex, ensuring robust performance and data management. 

The magic happens through the art of machine learning, facilitated by Replicate.com(https://replicate.com/jagilley/controlnet-scribble ). Replicate API is built on the Paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05543) Adding Conditional Control to Text-to-Image Diffusion Models , the model. This model was ran on Nvidia A100 (40GB) GPU hardware. Predictions typically complete within 7 seconds.
